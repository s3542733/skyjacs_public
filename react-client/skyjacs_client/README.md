# expo-react-native-web

This repo show how an Expo app (the default tabs template) can be extended with React Native Web support.

[See my blog post here](https://medium.com/@ron.arts/web-support-for-create-react-native-app-80b16f930326).

## How to use

Clone this repo, and run `yarn`.

Then start `exp start -c` in one terminal, in another start `exp ios`.

In yet another terminal start `yarn start` and connect your browser to `http://localhost:8080`.

Try resizing the browser.
